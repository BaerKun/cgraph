## CGraph
CGraph is a simple **C language** graph theory algorithm library.
It provides common graph algorithms and convenient iterator interfaces, suitable for learning.

## Features
- Topological Sort
- Unweighted shortest path (BFS)
- Weighted shortest path (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall)
- Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim, Kruskal)
- Maximum Flow (Edmonds-Karp)
- Euler Path & Circuit
- Articulation Points Detection
- Strongly Connected Components
- AOA Network Critical Path Analysis (Critical Path Method)
- Iterator Interfaces (traverse vertices and edges)
